Welcome! I am Michael D. Lowis and this is my personal web page. I am
an Embedded Software Engineer, currently employed at Gentex Corporation
in Zeeland, MI. I have a keen interest in the concepts of Software
Craftsmanship and clean software design. This site is meant to showcase
some of my own thoughts and projects regarding those concepts as well
as many others.
